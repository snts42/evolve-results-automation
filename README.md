# Evolve Results Automation

## Introduction

This is an **unofficial, open-source tool** to automate the retrieval and download of exam results and candidate reports from the City & Guilds Evolve platform, which lacks official API support.  
It is designed to assist centre/admin staff in downloading all candidate results and reports in a consistent, auditable, and efficient mannerâ€”saving hours of manual work and reducing human error.
