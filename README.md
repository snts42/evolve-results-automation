# Evolve Results Automation

## Introduction

This is an **unofficial, open-source tool** to automate the retrieval and download of exam results and candidate reports from the City & Guilds Evolve platform, which lacks official API support.  
It is designed to assist centre/admin staff in downloading all candidate results and reports in a consistent, auditable, and efficient mannerâ€”saving hours of manual work and reducing human error.

**This tool is intended for internal/admin use only.**  
It operates by automating browser actions and is for use by those with legitimate access to the Evolve platform. Never run this tool on untrusted machines. The project respects privacy, your data, and the Terms of Service of the sites you access.

## Features

- Logs in and navigates to the Evolve Results section.
- Downloads all result data into an Excel spreadsheet (`exam_results.xlsx`).
- Extracts and saves direct PDF links for candidate reports.
- Downloads all candidate reports as PDFs into an organised folder structure by date.
- Comprehensive logging and error handling for auditability and troubleshooting.

## Usage

There are **two scripts** included for modularity and ease of deployment:

1. **`evolve_scraper.py`**  
   - Logs in, navigates, and scrapes all exam results and PDF report URLs.
   - Outputs everything to `exam_results.xlsx`.

2. **`reports_downloader.py`**  
   - Reads the Excel, downloads all linked candidate reports, and organises them in folders by year/month/day.
   - Updates the Excel to track downloaded files.

> **Note:**  
> At present, the report scraping and download process is still **semi-manual for testing**:  
> The tool will prompt the user to press Enter at various steps (such as confirming page loads or after certain browser actions).  
> This ensures stability during development and troubleshooting.  
> A fully automated, "headless" version is planned for future releases, once all edge cases and are resolved.
